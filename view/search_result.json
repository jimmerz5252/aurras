The post-holiday buzz has me desperately searching for procrastination supplements from the unglamorous tasks of makeup schoolwork and closet cleaning. However, the Internet, though horrifyingly dangerous, can be a source of guidance and inspiration. While searching through the soul of my laptop, I came across an image titled Self-Help and it read:\nHow to stop time: kiss\nHow to travel in time: read\nHow to escape time: music\nHow to feel time: write\nHow to release time: breathe\nInstantly, I was swept up in the indefinite romance of this simple passage.
